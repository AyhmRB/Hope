# Hope
Hope is an online-education system with a built-in learning style detection functionality that aims to better educate young women in developing countries who have been unable to continue their education.

'Hope' is a branch of what started out as a very big idea in the minds of 5 teenagers currently practicing in the Teens in Ai Ada Lovelace Day Hackathon, that was later scaled down to better suit the experience and time limits of these people.
